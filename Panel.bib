  abstract = {In empirical work it is common to estimate parameters of models and report associated standard errors that account for "clustering" of units, where clusters are defined by factors such as geography. Clustering adjustments are typically motivated by the concern that unobserved components of outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, this motivation does not provide guidance about questions such as: (i) Why should we adjust standard errors for clustering in some situations but not others? How can we justify the common practice of clustering in observational studies but not randomized experiments, or clustering by state but not by gender? (ii) Why is conventional clustering a potentially conservative "all-or-nothing" adjustment, and are there alternative methods that respond to data and are less conservative? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these questions using a framework of sampling and design inference. We argue that clustering can be needed to address sampling issues if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters are sampled from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units are sampled from the sampled clusters. Then, clustered standard errors account for the existence of clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering can be needed to account for design issues if treatment assignment is correlated with membership in a cluster. We propose new variance estimators to deal with intermediate settings where conventional cluster standard errors are unnecessarily conservative and robust standard errors are too small.},

Considering conflicting theories and mixed prior evidence, we subject this question to a stringent test using large-scale, representative data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991\textendash 2009, N {$\approx$} 26,000) and the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009\textendash 2021, N {$\approx$} 80,000). We employ cross-lagged panel models with individual fixed effects to account for time-invariant confounders and reverse causality\textemdash two issues that have haunted earlier research. We find that frequency of religious service attendance on average has a positive impact on generalized trust, volunteering, and perceived cooperativeness. Other indicators of religious involvement have weaker effects. We also find variation across religious traditions: the effects of religious attendance are mostly positive for Anglicans and other Protestants, but weaker and mostly statistically insignificant for Catholics, Hindus, and the unaffiliated, and even negative for Muslims when the outcome is perceived cooperativeness. Our findings are robust to alternative model set-ups and hold up after accounting for neighbourhood religious composition, respondent and interviewer ethnicity, and other potential moderators and confounders. Altogether, our study shows that religious involvement can foster prosocial behaviours and attitudes, although in our study this effect is largely restricted to religious service attendance and majority religions.},

We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without \textbackslash textquotedblsparsity\textbackslash textquotedbl assumptions. We propose an \textbackslash textquotedblhonest\textbackslash textquotedbl approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the \textbackslash textquotedblground truth\textbackslash textquotedbl for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90\% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74\% and 84\% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7-22\%.}

We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Our method applies with time-varying controls, in triple-difference designs, and with certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of our results in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the United States, we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11 percent in the first quarter - about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models - and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.},

  abstract = {National and local governments have implemented a large number of policies, particularly non-pharmaceutical interventions, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Evaluating the effects of these policies, both on the number of Covid-19 cases as well on other economic outcomes is a key ingredient for policymakers to be able to determine which policies are most effective as well as the relative costs and benefits of particular policies. In this paper, we consider the relative merits of common identification strategies exploiting variation in policy choices made across different locations by checking whether the identification strategies are compatible with leading epidemic models in the epidemiology literature. We argue that unconfoundedness type approaches are likely to be more useful for evaluating policies than difference in differences type approaches due to the highly nonlinear spread of cases during a pandemic. For difference in differences, we further show that a version of this problem continues to exist even when one is interested in understanding the effect of a policy on other economic outcomes when those outcomes also depend on the number of Covid-19 cases. We propose alternative approaches that are able to circumvent these issues. We apply our proposed approach to study the effect of state level shelter-in-place orders early in the pandemic.}

We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular two-way fixed-effect specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation strategies that do not suffer from these drawbacks. Our results also cover cases where (i) there is no available untreated comparison group and (ii) there are multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, which are both common in empirical work.},

Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures, cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well. We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the results on business closures and stay-at-home orders. Finally, we stress that our study is observational and therefore should be interpreted with great caution. From a completely agnostic point of view, our findings uncover predictive effects (association) of observed policies and behavioral changes on future health outcomes, controlling for informational and other confounding variables.}

As preliminary evidence, our event-study analysis indicates that cases and deaths in counties with in-person or hybrid opening relative to those with remote opening substantially increased after the school opening date, especially for counties without any mask mandate for staff. Our main analysis uses a dynamic panel data model for case and death growth rates, where we control for dynamically evolving mitigation policies, past infection levels, and additive county-level and state-week ``fixed'' effects. This analysis shows that an increase in visits to both K\textendash 12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case and death growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K\textendash 12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases.

Moreover, there is substantial research showing how age and gender shape vulnerabilities to this environmental risk. However, there is only limited knowledge on how socioeconomic status (SES), operationalized using educational attainment, stratifies the effect of extreme temperatures on mortality. Here, we address this link using Poisson regression and administrative data from 2012 to 2018 for 50 Spanish Provinces on individuals aged above 65 matched with meteorological data provided by the E-OBS dataset. In line with previous studies, results show that hot and cold days increase mortality. Results on the interaction between SES and extreme temperatures show a positive and significant effect of exposure to heat and cold for individuals with medium and low SES level. Conversely, for high SES individuals we do not find evidence of a robust association with heat or cold. We further investigate how the local climate moderates these associations. A warmer climate increases risks with exposures to low temperatures and vice versa for hot temperatures in the pooled sample. Moreover, we observe that results are mostly driven by low SES individuals being particularly vulnerable to heat in colder climates and cold in warmer climates. In conclusion, results highlight how educational attainment stratifies the effect of extreme temperatures and the relevance of the local climate in shaping risks of low SES individuals aged above 65.},

Economists\textendash who generally can't run controlled experiments to test and validate their hypotheses\textendash apply these tools to observational data to make connections. In a messy world, causal inference is what helps establish the causes and effects of the actions being studied, whether the impact (or lack thereof) of increases in the minimum wage on employment, the effects of early childhood education on incarceration later in life, or the introduction of malaria nets in developing regions on economic growth. Scott Cunningham introduces students and practitioners to the methods necessary to arrive at meaningful answers to the questions of causation, using a range of modeling techniques and coding instructions for both the R and Stata programming languages. - -},

While previous research provides clear evidence for an inverse u-shaped pattern across an adult's life, much less is known about the formative period of adolescence and young adulthood. In this article, we examine changes in voluntary participation starting at age 14 and assess the impact of adolescents' educational transitions and their socioeconomic status. Our analyses rely on longitudinal survey data following a representative sample of adolescents in Germany (N = 5,013) over 6 years. Using fixed effects regression and moderated mediation analyses, we examine how adolescents' educational transitions and their socioeconomic status drive changes in participation. Results indicate a substantive decline in participation as individuals grow older. Transitions into higher tertiary education partly account for this decline. Finally, we find that adolescents from higher socioeconomic status are especially likely to reduce their participation, in part because they are more likely to undergo transitions into higher tertiary education. These findings suggest that the socioeconomic gap in participation decreases as adolescents grow older.},

We use European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data (EU-SILC) for 26 European countries between 2009 and 2018. In addition to describing the development of long-term poverty, we also analyse the drivers of poverty on the country level via fixed effects panel regression analysis. We are particularly interested in how economic growth, employment rates, social expenditure, and short-term poverty rates are related to long-term poverty. Overall, the results show that long-term poverty has increased in 13 out of 26 countries, but was unchanged or decreased in 13 countries. Gross domestic product growth is not related to the development of long-term poverty. However, we find that male employment and social welfare expenditure reduce poverty rates. Furthermore, short-term poverty is negatively associated with long-term poverty. Hence, short-term poverty and long-term poverty rather substitute than complement each other.},

However, whether marriage makes people more satisfied with life or whether more satisfied couples are more likely to marry remains a debated question. We reassess this relationship with panel data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) and extend previous analyses by adding individual trajectories (slopes) to standard fixed-effects regressions (FEIS). We are thereby able to distinguish \textendash{} controlling for time-constant unobserved heterogeneity \textendash{} whether there is in fact an effect of marriage on life satisfaction, whether people who are simply happier in their relationship are more likely to get married, or whether people whose development in life satisfaction is more positive are more likely to get married. We translate these different social mechanisms into different analytical strategies and find that OLS regression \textendash{} due to its confounding effects between and within persons \textendash{} overestimates the effect of marriage on life satisfaction. A fixed-effects estimator reveals a much lower effect of marriage on life satisfaction for couples who marry compared to those who continue to live apart together or cohabitate. Additionally, using a FEIS estimator and adjusting for \textendash{} non-linear \textendash{} development of individual life satisfaction over time, suggests that this effect is in fact causal.

However, algebraic transformations reveal that this strategy does not yield a within-unit estimator. Instead, the standard FE interaction estimator reflects unit-level differences of the interacted variables. This property allows interactions of a time-constant variable and a time-varying variable in FE to be estimated but may yield unwanted results if both variables vary within units. In such cases, Monte Carlo experiments confirm that the standard FE estimator of x {$\cdot$} z is biased if x is correlated with an unobserved unit-specific moderator of z (or vice versa). A within estimator of an interaction can be obtained by first demeaning each variable and then demeaning their product. This ``double-demeaned'' estimator is not subject to bias caused by unobserved effect heterogeneity. It is, however, less efficient than standard FE and only works with T {$>$} 2.},

Despite heated debates about citizenship policy, there exists almost no evidence that isolates the independent effect of naturalization from the nonrandom selection into naturalization. We provide new evidence from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums as the mechanism to decide naturalization requests. Balance checks suggest that for close naturalization referendums, which are decided by just a few votes, the naturalization decision is as good as random, so that narrowly rejected and narrowly approved immigrant applicants are similar on all confounding characteristics. This allows us to remove selection effects and obtain unbiased estimates of the long-term impacts of citizenship. Our study shows that for the immigrants who faced close referendums, naturalization considerably improved their political integration, including increases in formal political participation, political knowledge, and political efficacy.}

Joint assets reflect norms of sharing responsibilities and resources. Solely held assets, in contrast, offer individual economic independence. Using wealth data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP; 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017), we estimate individual fixed effects regressions. Although coefficients for all three wealth measures are positive, our results highlight that only increases in jointly held wealth are associated with statistically significant increases in spouses' life satisfaction in Germany. Despite expectations about a stronger relevance of joint wealth for men compared to women in line with men's role as a financial provider for the family, we do not find substantial gender differences in the positive association between increases in joint wealth and life satisfaction. In light of the individualisation of marriages, our results highlight that the personal benefits associated with marital sharing of wealth seem to trump those of economic independence and financial autonomy.},

  abstract = {This paper synthesizes recent advances in the econometrics of difference-in-differences (DiD) and provides concrete recommendations for practitioners. We begin by articulating a simple set of "canonical" assumptions under which the econometrics of DiD are well-understood. We then argue that recent advances in DiD methods can be broadly classified as relaxing some components of the canonical DiD setup, with a focus on \$(i)\$ multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, \$(ii)\$ potential violations of parallel trends, or \$(iii)\$ alternative frameworks for inference. Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that low-income households bear a higher exposure to environmental pollution than high-income households. Some scholars have argued that selective siting of industrial facilities accounts for such environmental inequality, while others have argued that those citizens who can afford to move out of polluted regions do so, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged are sorted into polluted areas. Yet empirical evidence regarding the processes of environmental inequality is not conclusive. We build on an original data set that includes annual georeferenced data of 6,570 highly polluting industrial facilities in Germany from 2008 to 2017 and validate the fluctuation in facilities with geographical land-use data. We then connect the facilities to income and demographic data for 4,455 municipalities and investigate sociodemographic changes before and after the appearance of new facilities. Spatial models are employed to measure local relative changes, and fixed-effects individual slopes estimators are used to account for selection on economic trajectories. Results provide only limited support for the selective siting thesis but show that an area's average income decreases after the appearance of new industrial facilities, thereby resonating with the selective migration hypothesis. In contrast, facility closure does not attract, or reattract, more affluent households.}

  abstract = {Fixed effects (FE) panel models have been used extensively in the past, as those models control for all stable heterogeneity between units. Still, the conventional FE estimator relies on the assumption of parallel trends between treated and untreated groups. It returns biased results in the presence of heterogeneous slopes or growth curves that are related to the parameter of interest (e.g., selection into treatment is based on individual growth of the outcome). In this study, we derive the bias in conventional FE models and show that fixed effects individual slope (FEIS) models can overcome this problem. This is a more general version of the conventional FE model, which accounts for heterogeneous slopes or trends, thereby providing a powerful tool for panel data and other multilevel data in general. We propose two versions of the Hausman test that can be used to identify misspecification in FE models. The performance of the FEIS estimator and the specification tests is evaluated in a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Using the examples of the marital wage premium and returns to preschool education (Head Start), we demonstrate how taking heterogeneous effects into account can seriously change the conclusions drawn from conventional FE models. Thus, we propose to test for bias in FE models in practical applications and to apply FEIS if indicated by the specification tests.},

Background               Previous research focused on men's gross wage marital premium to explore whether selection or specialization explains premiums. However, gross wages do not reflect disposable resources because taxes still have to be deducted. As the tax treatment varies across countries and by marital status, it is also relevant to consider such aspects.                                         Method               We use panel data from the United States (PSID), Germany (SOEP), and the United Kingdom (UKHLS) to examine annual male net earnings changes over marriage entry using fixed effect models with individual slopes. The models enable us to assess marriage-related net earnings while adjusting for heterogeneous age slopes before marriage in addition to any time-constant heterogeneity. Our sample contains 3244 US men, 4581 German men, and 7140 British men.                                         Results               Our results reveal a male marital net earnings premium only in Germany\textemdash a country with sizeable institutional marriage privileges. We go on to show heterogeneity in marriage effects by cohort, partner's education, and children. Results highlight that men from earlier cohorts and those married to partners with low education tend to benefit more.                                         Conclusion               Results add novel insights to our understanding of marital premiums and highlight the relevance of tax policy contexts as an institutional driver underlying marital premiums.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To what extent has the closing of the gender gap in hourly wages (`gender wage gap'; GWG) in Western Germany stalled due to an increasing supply of non-standard working hours? We use descriptive trend analyses and Juhn\textendash Murphy\textendash Pierce decompositions of German Socio-Economic Panel data for the last 30 years (1985\textendash 2014) to analyse the extent to which the expansion of part-time and marginal work, as well as overwork, may have contributed to the dynamics of the GWG in Western Germany. We find that the large increase in part-time work among women in combination with increasing wage gaps between part-time and full-time work substantially widened the GWG (by about one-sixth). Working hour effects were large enough to offset the equalizing effects of declining gender gaps in human capital, and they existed even in the public sector. In contrast to the United States, trends in overwork did not have a meaningful impact on the GWG. In an add-on, we find a widening of the gender gap in monthly earnings, but also an important closing of the gender earnings gap unconditional on employment due to an increased labour supply of women. Our results suggest that working hours should be given more consideration in research on family\textendash work conflict and gender earnings inequalities.},

Background               Previous research indicates that penalties only persist into mid-life for mothers with three or more children without distinguishing by race. The timing and age range in which parenthood wage gaps occur for fathers and mothers of different racial backgrounds are unknown. We develop a theoretical framework based on the gender- and race-specific interplay between labor market dynamics and family demographics over the life course to derive hypotheses.                                         Method               Age-specific parenthood wage gaps from ages 20\textendash 40 are estimated using 1979 and 1997 National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data and fixed effects models.                                         Results               Only White women with three or more children suffer large and persistent adjusted motherhood penalties up to age 40. For Black and Hispanic mothers, penalties are concentrated in a brief age range of 5\textendash 10\,years around age 30 and then attenuate irrespective of the number of children. Adjusted fatherhood premiums only occur for White men and are confined to brief periods in early adulthood, suggesting that they result from complex selection effects into education, employment, and fatherhood.                                         Conclusion               For minority men and women, parenthood wage gaps are concentrated in brief periods of the life course. Only White mothers with many children experience persistent wage penalties. The race- and gender-specific interplay between labor market dynamics and family demographics over the life course offers a consistent account of these findings.},

Previous cross-sectional studies indicate gender differences in further training, with lower participation rates and shorter training sessions for women, especially mothers. Based on the National Educational Panel Study for Germany (adult cohort, 2008\textendash 2020), this study is the first to examine gendered parenthood effects on participation in non-formal further job-related training using panel analyses. The results from fixed-effects regressions provide evidence of parenthood training penalties that are particularly pronounced for mothers and in the first years after childbirth. While fatherhood training penalties are mostly explained, motherhood gaps remain robust when accounting for a large number of time-varying characteristics. The results point towards further relevant changes in mothers' aspirations or employer support. Thus, they underline the importance of training opportunities for reducing childbirth-related inequalities later in life.},
